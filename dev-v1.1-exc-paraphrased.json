This imaginative geography is based on a revitalizing discourse that neither represents the diversity nor the social reality of the East. Rather, this discourse uses the idea of location-based identities to create the difference and distance between \"we\" West and \"they\" East, or \"here\" West and \"there\" East. This difference became particularly evident in text and visual works of the early European studies of the Orient, which made the East as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive West. The definition of the East as a negative vision of itself, as its inferiors, not only increased the self-esteem of the West, but was also an opportunity to arrange the East and make it known to the West so that it could be controlled and controlled. The Orientalism discourse therefore served as an ideological justification for early Western imperialism, as it formed a collection of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political and economic control over other areas.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 698, "text": "inferior"}, {"answer_start": 556, "text": "irrational and backward"}, {"answer_start": 694, "text": "its inferior"}, {"answer_start": 556, "text": "irrational and backward"}, {"answer_start": 698, "text": "inferior"}], "question": "The West saw the East as what?", "id": "57308f6b8ab72b1400f9c582"}]}, {"context": "It became a moral justification for raising the world to French standards, through Christianity and French culture.
