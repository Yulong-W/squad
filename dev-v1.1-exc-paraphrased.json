Robert Young writes that although imperialism operates from the center, it is a government policy and is developed for ideological and financial reasons, colonialism is simply the development of settlements or trade projects. Colonialism in modern use also implies a certain geographical separation between the colony and the imperial power. In particular, Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by saying: \"Imperialism contained \"the practice, theory and attitude of a dominant metropolitan center that rules a far-away territory,\" while colonialism refers to the \"implantation of settlements on a far-away territory.\" Related lands such as Russian or Ottoman are generally excluded from the discussion of colonialism.:116 Thus it can be said that imperialism contains a form of colonialism, but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism, because it does not have a political focus.[more explanation required]", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 224, "text": "person or group of people"}, {"answer_start": 222, "text": "a person or group of people"}, {"answer_start": 222, "text": "a person or group of people"}, {"answer_start": 224, "text": "person or group of people"}], "question": "Imperialism and colonialism both assert a states dominance over what?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce71"}]}, {"context": "The principles of imperialism are often generalized to the politics and practice of the British Empire \"in the last generation and, rather, through diagnosis rather than historical description\".

This imaginative geography is based on a revitalizing discourse that neither represents the diversity nor the social reality of the East. Rather, this discourse uses the idea of location-based identities to create the difference and distance between \"we\" West and \"they\" East, or \"here\" West and \"there\" East. This difference became particularly evident in text and visual works of the early European studies of the Orient, which made the East as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive West. The definition of the East as a negative vision of itself, as its inferiors, not only increased the self-esteem of the West, but was also an opportunity to arrange the East and make it known to the West so that it could be controlled and controlled. The Orientalism discourse therefore served as an ideological justification for early Western imperialism, as it formed a collection of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political and economic control over other areas.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 698, "text": "inferior"}, {"answer_start": 556, "text": "irrational and backward"}, {"answer_start": 694, "text": "its inferior"}, {"answer_start": 556, "text": "irrational and backward"}, {"answer_start": 698, "text": "inferior"}], "question": "The West saw the East as what?", "id": "57308f6b8ab72b1400f9c582"}]}, {"context": "It became a moral justification for raising the world to French standards, through Christianity and French culture.
