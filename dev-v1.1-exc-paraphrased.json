Firstly, Articles 1 to 4 generally require workers to be able to enter into employment, to enter into contracts and not to be discriminated against against against nationals of a Member State. In the famous case, the Belgian Football Association v. Bosman, Belgian footballer Jean-Marc Bosman, argued that he should be able to transfer to R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge USL Dunkerque after the conclusion of the contract, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the normal transfer fees. The Court held that 'transfer rules constitute an obstacle to free movement' and that they are unlawful unless they can be justified in the public interest, but this is unlikely. In In Groener v Minister of Education, the Court of Justice accepted that the requirement to teach Gaelics at the Dublin Model School may be justified as part of a general practice promoting Irish but only if the measure is not disproportionate. On the other hand, Angonese v. Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA, the Italian bank in Bolzano, was not allowed to claim from Angones a bilingual certificate available only from Bolzano. The Court of Justice, which gives 'horizontal' direct effect to Article 45 TFEU, argued that people from other countries had little chance of obtaining a certificate and that 'it is impossible to provide evidence of the required language skills in any other way' was disproportionate. Secondly, Article 7(2) requires equal treatment in taxation. In the Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker judgment, the Court held that it is contrary to Article 45 TFEU to refuse tax advantages (e.g. married couples and reductions in social security contributions) to a man who worked in Germany who lived in Belgium when other Germans received benefits. By contrast, in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg, the Court rejected Weigel\u2019s claim that the re-registration charge on his car brought into Austria infringed his right of free movement. Although the tax was likely to have a negative impact on migrant workers\u2019 decision to exercise their right to free movement, it had to be considered justified because the tax was applied equally to Austrians, even though there was no EU legislation on the matter. Thirdly, people must be treated equally with regard to'social benefits', even though the conditions of residence have been approved by the Court of Justice. In his judgment in Hendrix v Workers' Insurance Institution, the Court held that the Dutch national was not entitled to continue invalidity benefits when he moved to Belgium because the benefit was 'closely linked to the Dutch socio-economic situation'.
