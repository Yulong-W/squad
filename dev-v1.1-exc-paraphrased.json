The doctrine of legitimate trust, which originates in the principles of legal certainty and good faith, is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law. The legitimate doctrine of expectation states that \"those who act in good faith on the basis of the law as it is or seems should not be frustrated in their expectations.\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 186, "text": "international law and public law"}, {"answer_start": 186, "text": "international law and public law"}, {"answer_start": 186, "text": "international law and public law"}], "question": "Which laws mentioned predate EU law?", "id": "5726a14c708984140094cc52"}]}, {"context": "While the concept of the \"social market economy\" was introduced into EU law only in 2007, freedom of movement and trade have been at the heart of European development since the Treaty of Rome in 1957. According to the standard theory of comparative advantage, both countries can benefit from trade, even if one of them has a less productive economy in every respect. Like other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association or the World Trade Organisation, the removal of trade barriers and the improvement of the free movement of goods, services, labour and capital are aimed at reducing consumer prices. First of all, it was theorized that a free trade area would give way to a customs union that would lead to a common market, then to a monetary union, then to a monetary and fiscal union, and finally to a full and complete union of a state. In Europe, however, these steps have been significantly mixed, and it is still unclear whether the \"final game\" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice, free trade without standards for fair trade can benefit some individuals and groups within countries (especially large companies) much more than others, but it will affect people who do not have bargaining power in an expanding market, in particular workers, consumers, small businesses, development industries and communities. Articles 28 to 37 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union lay down the principle of the free movement of goods within the EU, while Articles 45 to 66 require the free movement of persons, services and capital. These \"four freedoms\" were hindered by physical (e.g. customs), technical (e.g. different safety, consumer or environmental laws) and tax (e.g. different VAT rates). The tension in the law is that freedom of movement and trade should not be distributed in a licence for unlimited commercial advantages. The Treaties restrict free trade to other values such as public health, consumer protection, workers' rights, fair competition and improvement of the environment. The Court is increasingly of the opinion that the specific objectives of free trade are supported by the general objectives of the Treaty to improve people's well-being.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 671, "text": "free trade"}, {"answer_start": 671, "text": "free trade"}, {"answer_start": 671, "text": "free trade"}], "question": "What do the Treaties generally limit?", "id": "5726b58f5951b619008f7b58"}]}, {"context": "Articles 1 to 7 of the Regulation on the free movement of workers contain the main provisions on equal treatment for workers. First, Articles 1 to 4 usually require workers to be able to take up employment, to conclude contracts and not to be discriminated against against nationals of a Member State. In the famous case, the Belgian football association against Bosman, the Belgian football player Jean-Marc Bosman, argued that he should be able to switch to R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge USL Dunkerque, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the normal transfer fees. The Court found that \"transfer rules constitute an obstacle to the free movement of persons\" and that they are illegal unless they can be justified in the public interest, but this is unlikely. In the In Groener case against education ministers, the Court accepted that the requirement to teach Gaelics at the Dublin Model School may be justified as part of a general practice to promote the Irish, but only if the measure is not disproportionate. On the other hand, Angonese v. Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA, the Italian bank in Bolzano, was not allowed to demand a bilingual certificate from Angonese, which was only available from Bolzano. The Court of Justice, which identifies Article 45 TFEU with \u2018horizontal' effect, argued that people from other countries have little chance of obtaining a certificate and that \u2018it is impossible to demonstrate otherwise the necessary language skills' is disproportionate. Secondly, Article 7(2) requires equal treatment in taxation. In the Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v. Schumacker, the Court ruled that it is contrary to Article 45 TFEU if a man who worked in Germany, who lived in Belgium, was refused tax benefits as other German benefits (e.g. married couples and reductions in social security contributions). In Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg, on the other hand, the court rejected Weigel's claim that the re-registration fee for his car brought to Austria was contrary to his right to free movement. Although the tax would probably have a negative impact on migrant workers, it had to be considered justified because the tax was also applied to Austrians, although there was no EU legislation in this respect. Thirdly, people must be treated equally with regard to \"social benefits\", even if the conditions for residence have been approved by the Court of Justice. In its judgment in Hendrix v. Arbeitsversicherungsanstalt, the Court held that the Dutch national was not entitled to continue invalidity benefits when moving to Belgium, since the benefit was \u2018closely linked to the economic and social situation of the Netherlands'. On the other hand, the Court of Justice in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen ruled that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, who works in Germany for between 3 and 14 hours per week, was not entitled to German child allowances, even if the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but lived in Austria could have. The general justification for restricting freedom of movement in Article 45(3) TFEU is \u2018public policy, public security or public health' and Article 45(4) also includes a general exception to \u2018employment in the public service'.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 870, "text": "Gaelic"}, {"answer_start": 870, "text": "Gaelic"}, {"answer_start": 870, "text": "Gaelic"}], "question": "What language did the Court of Justice accept to be required to teach in a Dublin college in Groner v Minister for Education?", "id": "5726bc1add62a815002e8ea8"}]}]}, {"title": "Amazon_rainforest", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The Amazon rain forest (also known as \"Amaz\u00f4nica\" or \"Amaz\u00f4nia\" or \"Amaz\u00f4nia\" or \"Amaz\u00f3nica\" or \"Amaz\u00f3nica\" or \"Amaz\u00f3nica\" or \"Amaz\u00f4nia\") is a humid deciduous forest in South America covering most of the Amazon basin.

Since stone units, other than clay, do not change significantly in volume, this is achieved in two primary ways: through errors and wrinkles. In the flat crust, where brittle deformations can occur, shock defects are formed, thereby moving deeper stone on flat stone. Since deeper stones are often older, as the principle of superimposition shows, this can lead to older stones moving over the younger. The movement along faults can lead to folds, either because the faults are not flat or because rock layers are drawn along, resulting in folds that slip along the fault. Deeper in the ground, stones behave plastically and fold instead of wrong. These folds can be either those in which the material buckles up in the middle of the folds, creates \"antiforms\" or bends down, creates \"synforms\".
