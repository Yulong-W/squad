This has meant that both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles for resolving conflicts of law between different systems. The Court of Justice considers that if EU law is contrary to a provision of national law, EU law prevails. In the first major case in 1964, Costa refused ENEL, a lawyer in Milan, and former shareholders of an energy company, named Mr Costa, to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy companies. He argued that the Italian Nationalisation Act was contrary to the Treaty of Rome and asked for a reference to be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under Article 267 TFEU. The Italian Constitutional Court considered that since the Nationalisation Law was from 1962, and the Treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. On the other hand, the European Court of Justice held that the Treaty of Rome did not in any way prevent energy nationalisation, and in any case, under the provisions of the Treaty, only the Commission could have claimed, not Costa. However, Paolo Costa was in principle entitled to claim that the Treaty was contrary to national law, and the Court would be obliged to examine his claim to make a reference in the absence of an appeal. The European Court of Justice reiterated its position in Van Gend en Loos, said the Member States \"although in limited areas, have limited their sovereign rights and created a law applicable both to their citizens and to themselves\" on the basis of reciprocity. EU legislation would not be \"infringed by national legal provisions, however they are designed... without calling into question the legal basis of the Community itself\". This meant that any \"one-sided act in succession\" in the Member State did not apply. Similarly, one company, Simmenthal SpA, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, claimed that under an Italian law of 1970 on imports of beef from France into Italy, a fee for public health surveillance was contrary to two Regulations of 1964 and 1968. In line with the principle of primacy of Community law, the Court of Justice of the European Communities stated that \u2018the directly applicable measures of the institutions' (e.g. the regulations in the present case) \u2018may not be applied automatically to any conflicting provisions of existing national law'. This was necessary in order to prevent the \"equivalent denial\" of the Treaty \"obligations which the Member States have unconditionally and irrevocably undertaken\", which could \"prevent the very foundations of the EU\".

In Pubblico Ministero v Ratti, since the Italian Government had failed to transpose in time Directive 73/173/EEC on the packaging and labelling of solvents, Ratti ceased to apply a national law of 1963 against the solvent and varnish industry. A Member State \"may not rely on its own failure to comply with the obligations arising from the Directive vis-\u00e0-vis individuals\". Secondly, a citizen or an undertaking may invoke a directive, not only in a dispute with an authority, but also in a dispute with another citizen or company. In the CIA Security case against Signalson and Securitel, the Court found that a company known as CIA Security could defend itself against competitors' claims that it had failed to comply with a Belgian Decree of 1991 on alarm systems because it had not been notified to the Commission as a necessary directive. Thirdly, if a directive expresses a \"general principle\" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-governmental parties before the transposition deadline expires. This follows from K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG, where the Civil Code \u00a7622 stated that the years during which the work was under 25 years would not count on the increasing statutory dismissal before the dismissal. K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci worked for Sweden GmbH & Co KG for 10 years, from 18 to 28 years, before she was fired. She argued that the law, which did not count her age under 25 years, was illegal age discrimination under the directive on equal treatment for men and women. The Court found that it could invoke the Directive, since equality was also a general principle of EU law. Thirdly, if the defendant is an emanation of the State, even if not the central government, he may still be bound by guidelines. In Foster v British Gas plc, the Court held that Foster was entitled to claim discrimination against her employer, British Gas plc, who retired women aged 60 and men aged 65 if (1) she had been a public servant and (3) had special powers under a State measure (2).

The adoption of laws that will have legal effect in the European Union must have an appropriate legal basis. The legislation of the Member States applying European Union law must be formulated in such a way that it is clearly understandable to those who are subject to the law. In EU law, the general principle of legal certainty prohibits ex-post facto laws, i.e. laws should not enter into force before their publication. The doctrine of legitimate expectations, rooted in the principles of legal certainty and good faith, is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law.

In the case of such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indiscriminately applicable\") measures, the Court has developed more justifications: either those in Article 36 or additional \"compulsory\" or \"superior\" requirements such as consumer protection, improvement of labour standards, environmental protection, press diversity, fairness in trade and more: the categories are not closed. In the most well-known case of Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not only imported) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 percent infringed Article 34 TFEU, as it had a more negative effect on imports. The German liqueurs were over 25 percent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, whom Rewe-Zentrale AG wanted to import from France, had only 15 to 20 percent alcohol. The Court rejected the German Government's argument that the measure had proportionately protected public health in accordance with Article 36 TFEU, since stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling was sufficient to enable consumers to understand what they had bought. This rule applies primarily to requirements relating to the content or packaging of a product. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA, the Court found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be placed in cube-shaped packaging was contrary to Article 34 and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would consider it to be butter if it were not cube-shaped was disproportionate: it would \"exceed considerably the requirements of the subject matter\" and the labelling would protect consumers \"as effectively\". In a 2003 case, the Commission's Italian legislation against Italy required that cocoa products containing other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \"chocolate\". It had to be chocolate substitutes. All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish producers used other vegetable fats. They claimed that the law infringed Article 34. The Court found that a low level of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the eyes of consumers. A \"neutral and objective statement\" was sufficient to protect consumers. Where Member States impose significant obstacles to the use of a product, this may also violate Article 34. In a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court found that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds to pull trailers infringes Article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to all but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies do not produce trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the court argued that the ban would prevent people from buying: it would have \"a significant influence on consumer behaviour\" which \"impacts access to this product to the market\".
